# Package: babs_lidar_wobbler

This package works with baxter_gripper and hokuyo_node packages (as well a Hokuyo 2D LIDAR and a Dynamixel mx-28 motor) to provide wobbling lidar point cloud publishes for the BABS sentry robot system.


# Usage
Start everything you need bu running the only launch file: full_launch.launch. This starts static and dynamic transforms, motor wobbling publishers, and the point cloud stitcher nodes.
